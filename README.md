# Sonic CD R11A Disassembly

This is my incomplete disassembly of R11A from Sonic CD from 2020. Files are split and about half of the code is documented. It is also buildable and the level can be modified in SonLVL. Someone could probably use this more than me nowadays, so here it is.

Special thanks to Flamewing and TheStoneBanana for extensive help over the years.
